Victory Energy Corporation     Dated: February 6, 2015   /s/ Kenneth Hill    Kenneth HillChief Executive Officer 3    EX-99.1 2 lucasandvictorymerger.htm EXHIBIT 99.1     LucasandVictoryMerger Victory Energy and Lucas Energy  Announce Proposed Business Combination AUSTIN, Texas  (February 4, 2015). Victory Energy Corporation, (OTCQX: VYEY) (Victory) a rapidly growing Permian Basin focused oil and gas company, and Lucas Energy Inc. (NYSE MKT: LEI) (\"Lucas\"), an asset rich  Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford focused oil and gas company, announced today that they have executed a Letter of Intent and Term Sheet for a proposed business combination between the two companies.  The business combination is contingent on the signing of a definitive merger agreement, which will contain customary terms and conditions.  The parties expect that the business combination will involve the issuance of equity by Lucas to Victorys shareholders with no cash payment being made. The parties also expect that upon completion of the business combination, the shareholders of Victory and Victorys partner Navitus Energy Group will own more than a majority of outstanding Lucas shares. The letter of intent contains a binding exclusivity provision that requires the two companies to work toward a definitive merger agreement to the exclusion of other potential merger partners. Victory and Lucas are also negotiating the terms of a funding agreement that is intended to provide the capital necessary for Lucas to satisfy its obligations for several Eagle Ford wells, critical accounts payable and to provide Lucas with necessary working capital during the period prior to the consummation of the business combination.  The parties expect that as part of the transaction seven of Lucas high-grade Eagle Ford wells with varying working interests from a portfolio of 130 future drilling locations will be funded and brought into production during the period from February through June of 2015.   Based on nearby EOG Resources and Marathon Oil well production volumes in addition to internal economic reservoir calculations, the parties anticipate that the monthly production revenue from these combined wells will exceed $1,100,000 of revenue to the company interest, assuming a price per barrel of oil of $50, which would bring both companies into a positive cash-flow position and add significant proved producing reserves to the combined 2015 company portfolio.   Victory and Lucas expect that funding of these obligations will come from a variety of sources, including certain affiliates of Victory.  These sources anticipate total funding needs of approximately $12 million during the business combination with additional funding for post-closing debt reduction and expansion to exceed $8 million.  The expected combination of the two companies will allow Victory and Lucas shareholders to enjoy the benefits of a much larger NYSE MKT listed company, the synergies of a single management structure and reporting company, which will hold valuable assets in two of the most active and profitable basins in North America, the Permian and the Eagle Ford, said Kenny Hill, Chief Executive Officer of Victory Energy Corporation.  We are extremely excited by the opportunity to combine with Victory.  We believe that the proposed combination will enhance our access to capital, diversify our asset base, strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to scale.  We are pleased to have identified a strategic partner that can help us expand our scope of operations and improve our financial condition, said Anthony C. Schnur, Chief Executive Officer of Lucas Energy Inc.  Kenneth E. Hill, the current Chief Executive Officer and Director of Victory Energy, is expected to serve as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the combined company.  Other executive and officer appointments will be determined at a later date.About Victory Energy CorporationVictory Energy Corporation (OTCQX: VYEY), is a public held, growth-oriented oil and gas exploration and production company based in Austin, Texas, with additional resources located in Midland, Texas.

Victory Energy Corporation     Dated: February 6, 2015   /s/ Kenneth Hill    Kenneth HillChief Executive Officer 3    EX-99.1 2 lucasandvictorymerger.htm EXHIBIT 99.1     LucasandVictoryMerger Victory Energy and Lucas Energy  Announce Proposed Business Combination AUSTIN, Texas  (February 4, 2015). Victory Energy Corporation, (OTCQX: VYEY) (Victory) a rapidly growing Permian Basin focused oil and gas company, and Lucas Energy Inc. (NYSE MKT: LEI) (\"Lucas\"), an asset rich  Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford focused oil and gas company, announced today that they have executed a Letter of Intent and Term Sheet for a proposed business combination between the two companies.  The business combination is contingent on the signing of a definitive merger agreement, which will contain customary terms and conditions.  The parties expect that the business combination will involve the issuance of equity by Lucas to Victorys shareholders with no cash payment being made. The parties also expect that upon completion of the business combination, the shareholders of Victory and Victorys partner Navitus Energy Group will own more than a majority of outstanding Lucas shares. The letter of intent contains a binding exclusivity provision that requires the two companies to work toward a definitive merger agreement to the exclusion of other potential merger partners. Victory and Lucas are also negotiating the terms of a funding agreement that is intended to provide the capital necessary for Lucas to satisfy its obligations for several Eagle Ford wells, critical accounts payable and to provide Lucas with necessary working capital during the period prior to the consummation of the business combination.  The parties expect that as part of the transaction seven of Lucas high-grade Eagle Ford wells with varying working interests from a portfolio of 130 future drilling locations will be funded and brought into production during the period from February through June of 2015.   Based on nearby EOG Resources and Marathon Oil well production volumes in addition to internal economic reservoir calculations, the parties anticipate that the monthly production revenue from these combined wells will exceed $1,100,000 of revenue to the company interest, assuming a price per barrel of oil of $50, which would bring both companies into a positive cash-flow position and add significant proved producing reserves to the combined 2015 company portfolio.   Victory and Lucas expect that funding of these obligations will come from a variety of sources, including certain affiliates of Victory.  These sources anticipate total funding needs of approximately $12 million during the business combination with additional funding for post-closing debt reduction and expansion to exceed $8 million.  The expected combination of the two companies will allow Victory and Lucas shareholders to enjoy the benefits of a much larger NYSE MKT listed company, the synergies of a single management structure and reporting company, which will hold valuable assets in two of the most active and profitable basins in North America, the Permian and the Eagle Ford, said Kenny Hill, Chief Executive Officer of Victory Energy Corporation.  We are extremely excited by the opportunity to combine with Victory.  We believe that the proposed combination will enhance our access to capital, diversify our asset base, strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to scale.  We are pleased to have identified a strategic partner that can help us expand our scope of operations and improve our financial condition, said Anthony C. Schnur, Chief Executive Officer of Lucas Energy Inc.  Kenneth E. Hill, the current Chief Executive Officer and Director of Victory Energy, is expected to serve as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the combined company.  Other executive and officer appointments will be determined at a later date.About Victory Energy CorporationVictory Energy Corporation (OTCQX: VYEY), is a public held, growth-oriented oil and gas exploration and production company based in Austin, Texas, with additional resources located in Midland, Texas.
